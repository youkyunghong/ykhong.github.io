# 👋 About Me

I’m **Youkyung Hong**, a senior researcher at Electronics and Telecommunications Research Institute (ETRI), Daejeon, South Korea. I received my B.S. degree in Mechanical Engineering from POSTECH in 2010, and my M.S. and Ph.D. degrees in Mechanical and Aerospace Engineering from Seoul National University in 2012 and 2018, respectively. My research interests include optimization and its applications to various autonomous systems.

### 🔍 Interests
- Heuristics and sub-optimal solutions

- Robust optimization under uncertainty

- Reinforcement learning

- Air traffic management: conflict resolution, sequencing and scheduling

- Autonomous multi-UAV system: mission planning, task assignment, path planning
